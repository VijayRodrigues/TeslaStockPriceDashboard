# TeslaStockPriceDashboard

## Description

This Tableau dashboard is provides detailed information on the stock prices of Tesla. This dashboard is linked to dataset that updates on a daily basis. 
In this project prices are considered for the last 3 months however with the help of available filter you can change the data frequency.

To get the pricing data I have used GOOGLEFINANCE function on Google Sheets to generate dataset. You can refer to teh below link to learn more about the uses of the function.
